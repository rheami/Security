multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2014-8626)","Upgrade to PHP version 5.2.8 or later.

multiple vulnerabilities.","According to its banner, the version of PHP installed on the remote
host is prior to 5.2.7. It is, therefore, affected by multiple
vulnerabilities :

  - There is a buffer overflow flaw in the bundled PCRE
    library that allows a denial of service attack.
    (CVE-2008-2371)

  - Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities exist in
    functions such as 'posix_access', 'chdir', and 'ftok'
    that allow a remote attacker to bypass 'safe_mode'
    restrictions. (CVE-2008-2665 and CVE-2008-2666).

  - A buffer overflow flaw in 'php_imap.c' may be triggered
    when processing long message headers due to the use of
    obsolete API calls. This can be exploited to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2008-2829)

  - A buffer overflow in the 'imageloadfont' function in
    'ext/gd/gd.c' can be triggered when a specially crafted
    font is given. This can be exploited to cause a denial
    of service or to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3658)

  - A buffer overflow flaw exists in PHP's internal function
    'memnstr' which can be exploited by an attacker using
    the delimiter argument to the 'explode' function. This
    can be used to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2008-3659)

  - When PHP is used as a FastCGI module, an attacker by
    requesting a file whose file name extension is preceded
    by multiple dots can cause a denial of service.
    (CVE-2008-3660)

  - A heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the mbstring
    extension can be triggered via a specially crafted
    string containing an HTML entity that is not handled
    during Unicode conversion. This can be exploited to
    execute arbitrary code.(CVE-2008-5557)

  - Improper initialization of global variables 'page_uid'
    and 'page_gid' when PHP is used as an Apache module
    allows the bypassing of security restriction due to
    SAPI 'php_getuid' function overloading. (CVE-2008-5624)

  - PHP does not enforce the correct restrictions when
    'safe_mode' is enabled through a 'php_admin_flag'
    setting in 'httpd.conf'. This allows an attacker, by
    placing a specially crafted 'php_value' entry in
    '.htaccess', to able to write to arbitrary files.
    (CVE-2008-5625)

  - The 'ZipArchive::extractTo' function in the ZipArchive
    extension fails to filter directory traversal sequences
    from file names. An attacker can exploit this to write
    to arbitrary files. (CVE-2008-5658)

  - Under limited circumstances, an attacker can cause a
    file truncation to occur when calling the 'dba_replace'
    function with an invalid argument. (CVE-2008-7068)

  - A buffer overflow error exists in the function
    'date_from_ISO8601' function within file 'xmlrpc.c'
    because user-supplied input is improperly validated.
    This can be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service or to execute arbitrary code.

    handling highly compressed bodies. Using a specially
    crafted request, a remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service by exhausting memory and CPU
    resources. (CVE-2014-0118)

  - The 'mod_status' module contains a race condition that
    can be triggered when handling the scoreboard. A remote
    attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service,
    execute arbitrary code, or obtain sensitive credential
    information. (CVE-2014-0226)

  - The 'mod_cgid' module lacks a time out mechanism. Using
    a specially crafted request, a remote attacker can use
    this flaw to cause a denial of service by causing child
    processes to linger indefinitely, eventually filling up
    the scoreboard. (CVE-2014-0231)

relied only on the application's self-reported version number.","Upgrade to Apache version 2.2.29 or later.

remote host is prior to 2.2.28. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - An flaw exists within the 'mod_headers' module which
    allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary headers.
    This is done by placing a header in the trailer portion
    of data being sent using chunked transfer encoding.
